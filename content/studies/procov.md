There is no reliable data on the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. Representative studies would therefore be necessary.
A representative population group could be all hospital employees, from cleaning staff to administrative staff to nurses and doctors. At least this would be a representative group of healthcare workers. All employees are included in this prospective observational study to demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 through repeated molecular tests and repeated antibody tests. For this purpose, a weekly smear for PCR on SARS-CoV-2 and weekly antibody tests are carried out. In addition, blood samples are preserved for testing for seroconversion. This data is correlated with a daily online survey. All data are evaluated every 3 months to determine the spread pattern.
