## Brief Summary in Lay Language
The objective of this study is to determine the proportion of people in the general population of Heidelberg and the Rhein-Neckar region with antibodies against the coronavirus.

## Brief Summary in Scientific Language
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the age-group specific prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among the general population of Heidelberg and the Rhein-Neckar region. In total 1500 persons from five age-groups will be randomly selected from the population registers. Study participants will be tested for antibodies at three different time points: one study visit will take place during the current epidemic, one post-epidemic and one between these two timepoints. A questionnaire will be administered at each study visit to collect information about symptoms and potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
