This project aims to close existing gaps between clinical, epidemiological and immunological information in order to better respond to the Covid-19 [pandemic](https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/pandemic/). European researchers from the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany, as well as partners from China, Ivory Coast and Nepal are working together to achieve this goal. In addition, existing cross- or partial immunity against [SARS](https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/sars/)-CoV-2 is to be investigated in Germany and Nepal. The data collected will help to better assess the transmission of the virus and evaluate the effectiveness of measures against its spread.
