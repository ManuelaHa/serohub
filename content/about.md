## Scope
The LEOSS.COVIM.sero-survey is a platform to establish a research forum/ information environment, focusing on knowledge sharing, creating and fostering activities. The Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI)/German Center for Infection Research(DZIF), Robert-Koch Institute (RKI) and COVIM provides the unique possibility to combine all case based data collected during seroprevalence and immune studies about COVID-19 to conduct meta-analysis for the National Network of University Medicine (NUM) and other interested researcher (you). Furthermore, LEOSS.COVIM.sero-survey provides a general overview of research activities about seroprevalence studies.

## What is seroprevalence?
In epidemiological terms __prevalence__ is the proportion of people in a population who have a disease.

Consequently __seroprevalence__ is the proportion of people who were tested positive for a specific disease based on serology (blood serum). Seroprevalence studies help determine the infection dynamics in geographical regions or population subgroups.
