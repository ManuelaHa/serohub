## A new dashboard

After a long period of data cleaning processes and study aquisition, we are presenting the dashboard with selected KPI of the data included in the serohub. We thank all participants and we are looking forward to our first publication.

The dashboard is directly available via [https://gstephan30.github.io/sero_dash/](https://gstephan30.github.io/sero_dash/), or via the dashboard button in the [studies section](https://serohub.net/en/studies/).
