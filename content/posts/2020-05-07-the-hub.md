## Introduction

The purpose of the **LEOSS.sero-survey** platform is to establish an __open research forum and information environment__, focusing on knowledge sharing, creating and fostering activities. Furthermore, LEOSS.sero-survey provides a general overview of research activities about seroprevalence studies.

### Overview of seroprevalence studies

The platform will provide an overview of all participating studies, including:

* Study Population,
* Time of sampling,
* Total population in the area,
* Research questions,
* Diagnostic test,
* When the start of sampling is expected,
* Funding source, and
* When first results are expected

### Later stages

All contributing researchers will have the opportunity to submit anonymized aggregated data and perform a meta-analysis with the data that other researchers also share.

### Website concept
