The [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) (EBI) is engaged in discussion about standardization of reporting on serology data, in order to be able to integrate serolomics into the [COVID-19 Data Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/). The LEOSS.sero-survey, was invited contribute in all discussions. For this the EBI gathered researcher from across all major key players of seroprevalence studies within Europe.

We are really looking forward to this collaboration. This will improve the definition of our [minimal dataset](/en/contribute) . To dive into the topic we suggest reading:

* [STARD 2015 guidance, *"Standards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies"*](https://www.equator-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/STARD-2015-checklist.pdf)
* [WHO protocol, *"Population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation protocol for COVID-19 virus infection"*](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/inaugural-who-partners-forum/covid-19-seroepidemiological-investigation-protocol-v3.pdf)
