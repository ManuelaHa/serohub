## Scope
The LEOSS.sero-survey is a platform to establish a research forum/ information environment, focusing on knowledge sharing, creating and fostering activities. Furthermore, LEOSS.sero-survey provides a general overview of research activities about seroprevalence studies.

## What is seroprevalence?
In epidemiological terms __prevalence__ is the proportion of people in a population who have a disease.

Consequently __seroprevalence__ is the proportion of people who were tested positive for a specific disease based on serology (blood serum). Seroprevalence studies help determine the infection dynamics in geographical regions or population subgroups.
